# Benjamin Wortmann 
I'm Benjamin from Germany. In 2019, I received a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in the field of automation engineering from the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg, Germany. After graduating, I worked as IT administrator in a small consulting company for two years.After leaving the company in early 2021, I decided to make a career change and attended a training course to become a data analyst for four months. After I successfully completed the training, I've continued learning statistics and R programming on my own.
