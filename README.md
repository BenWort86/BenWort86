### :technologist: About Me: 
I'm Benjamin from Germany. In 2019, I received a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in the field of automation technology from the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg, Germany. After graduating, I worked as IT administrator in a small consulting company for two years.After leaving the company in early 2021, I decided to make a career change and attended a training course to become a data analyst for four months. After I successfully completed the training, I've continued learning statistics and R programming on my own. In my free time I love to:

* :closed_book: Read books
* :dog2: Play with my dog
* :infinity: Do mathematics
* :video_game: Play computer games
* :man_cartwheeling: Do sports

And last but not least :point_right: :coffee:
